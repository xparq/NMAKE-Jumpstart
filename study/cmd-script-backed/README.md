Extracted from the ongoing OON build system revamp.

The optional non-CMD \_build.sh script here is just a detour, an alternative
or reference baseline (-> integration back, later!), and the weird busybox
dependency is simply a distraction (remnants from the donor prj).

The focus is on `tooling/build/brutebuild.cmd`!
